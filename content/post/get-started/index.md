In the past several months, I have been trying to develop a model with my advisor Cristina Moya to capture both identity-driven polarization and the biased social learning process of public discussion dynamics. The model-developing process is challenging but has been helpful for understanding the aesthetics of a good model and the meaning of true emergence.

## Read a lot of models

When you are new in the modeling world, it is hard to know what to read. Start with one book in your field that summarizes the classical models you need to know. Question-driven reading is more effective. For example, I am interested in identity signaling and information transmission, so I read signaling models, coordination models, social learning models, and their empirical applications.

## A small modeling thought

One hypothesis is that college education spreads out the cost of social learning: the cost in time, money, and errors is shifted from a small fraction of people to a larger group. Another hypothesis is that college education creates a large pool of information carriers so that even with information loss during cultural transmission, the total amount of knowledge is retained or grows. The two hypotheses might be modeled in similar ways but imply different mechanisms.
