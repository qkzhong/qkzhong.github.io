I have an idea that comes from a biological phenomenon of system robustness. If the system does not detect and correct errors, accumulated error reduces performance. If the system is too sensitive to errors, it cannot remain robust.

During COVID-19, many governments used information control. If the news agency is an error-detection mechanism, then to maintain robustness and stability, the system may reduce sensitivity and control how much information people can access. Otherwise, panic could lead to hoarding and preempting resources.

If people do not get enough information, they cannot correctly perceive how dangerous the situation is, which can speed contagion and increase damage. Over time, the government may lose trust, which also reduces robustness.

This suggests a need to model information control and its influence on individual behavior and collective patterns. The key question is the equilibrium amount of information a government will allow releasing to maintain robustness.
