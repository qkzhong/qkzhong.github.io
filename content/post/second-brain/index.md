This machine learning idea raises a question: when does an algorithm understand the logic of a game? It is the same question I ask when watching people play video games: is there a point between getting familiar with a skill and understanding the logic?

One view is through information theory. The golden mean process shows that block entropy can reveal structure at certain lengths. At length 2, the system realizes the logic: there shall not be consecutive 0s.

Another view is through learning. Social learning is puzzling because it is hard to tell if we do what our peers do or if we are learning consequences they already discovered. I want to build a model where agents follow local rules but can generalize after moving across environments, using memory and adaptation.

A third view is humanistic. We often say a musician shows sophistication in how they play Bach, and creativity emerges from repeated practice. How do we examine creativity? It might be best left to creative people.

Bourdieu might say all social processes are status games. If you understand the game, do you learn how to escape it?
