I noticed that professors are usually less emotional than grad students during presentations, lunches, and meetings. Several models may explain this:

1. Less emotional graduate students are selected to be professors in the job market.
2. Training in grad school transforms grad students into less emotional people.
3. Being less emotional is a professional requirement for professors.
4. Professors are older than grad students, and older people are less emotional.
5. Professors have better life quality than students and thus experience less extreme emotions.

Model 1 could be tested by surveying students on the job market and correlating emotion with success, though that is hard. Model 2 could be tested by comparing junior and senior grad students. Model 3 could be tested by comparing junior and senior professors. Model 4 could compare faculty at the same career stage but different ages. Model 5 overlaps with model 3 but focuses on psychological state rather than behavior.

The practice question remains: should I act less emotional to get a job? Maybe not.
