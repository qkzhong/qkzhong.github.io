abstract: "We develop an agent-based model to study the co-evolution of wealth inequality, biased perceptions of wealth, and their influence on wealth taxation and redistribution. The model integrates random multiplicative wealth dynamics, flat taxation with partial redistribution, and homophily-driven rewiring of social ties."
